alwaysApply: true

- IMPORTANT: Apply these effects across all viewports (Extra Small: 0px–575px, Small: 576px–767px, Medium: 768px–991px, Large: 992px–1199px, Extra Large: 1200px–1399px, Extra Extra Large: 1400px and above) to maintain a consistent and professional appearance.

- IMPORTANT: Transition effects should be smooth, subtle, and avoid jarring movements to ensure accessibility and usability. Use ease-in-out timing for natural transitions.

- IMPORTANT: Animation effects should be minimal to avoid distraction, prioritizing subtle fades, scales, or slides. Avoid excessive animations that could impact performance on low-end devices (e.g., Extra Small viewports).

- IMPORTANT: Button hover effects should follow the specified color scheme: light background buttons transition to `background: #115056; color: #fff`, dark background buttons transition to `background: #fff; color: #115056`. Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance).

- IMPORTANT: Section-based animations should trigger as follows: the first section animates on page load/reload, while subsequent sections (e.g., second and third) animate when scrolled into the viewport. This ensures a dynamic and engaging user experience without overwhelming the initial page load.
